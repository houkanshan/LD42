        As every other game, this game welcomes its players, so of course more players are constantly welcomed. Unfortunately, we are sorry to announce that the seats are limited due to unidentified logistical problems, meaning that we are unable to satisfy the needs of all potential players simultaneously. Thus, in order to guarantee your (and anyone else’s) optimal experience within this virtual environment, some general rules need to be explained and clarified.
      </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h5>[As the player]</h5>
      <p>As a player, you are able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personalize your Bio</strong> as a way to introduce yourself and communicate with other active players. You may only edit your bio once per 12 hours, and each such valid action will score you 5 pts.
        <li><strong>Share your success story,</strong> which will then be displayed on the homepage to encourage or discourage all potential players from joining the game. You may only edit your shared story once per 6 hours, and each such valid action will score you 3 pts.
        <li><strong>Just stay there,</strong> and simply be yourself. You gain 1 Level-up after each passing day (the timer resets at every midnight, GMT time), 10 bonus pts will be awarded every time you level up.
        <li><strong>Log out current session</strong> to get back to the homepage, wherein you are able to create a new character or login as another existing character. Each individual IP address is allowed to possess up to 3 characters.
      </ul>
      <p>
        You must have also noticed the colored progress bar down there, which clearly indicates the current player count and the maximum number allowed. Once it reaches its full capacity, a 48-hour countdown will be initialized, after which all active players will be automatically removed from this game, to make space for more future players indeed. Undoubtedly, such catastrophic loss is not something anyone wants to see, and that’s why admins are included in this equilibrium.
      </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <h5>[As the admin]</h5>
      <p>
        An admin’s sole and only duty is to invalidate the countdown timer,
        or simply prevent it from ever happening,
        by manually removing redundant players from the game.
        However, admins are played by real human beings,
        and humans make errors.
        In scenarios where the admins forgot or neglected their duties,
        any player is more than welcome to send an email
        to <a href="mailto:sero@serotoninphobia.info">sero@serotoninphobia.info</a> to
        remind them their responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>
        These are pretty much everything you need to know to enjoy this game.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wish you good luck, and godspeed.
